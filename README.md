# Static Load Of Rope
This case of rope loads occurs when the interaction force in the "climber-rope" system does not change over time, or it changes very slowly.

Under the influence of climber mass and tension in the lines, the "rope-climber" system contained in the state of equilibrium, which clearly is not included in the replenishment, they are so small that they can be omitted. In other words, the strength in the lines is constant or increases very slowly.

On the initial linear load with the force of **Q = mg** applied statically. Let us assume that the stresses in the lines are not subject to material elasticity limits, which clearly means that after stabilizing the lines they return to the original length **L**

Due to the static influence of the body **Q** on the rope, its deformation **c** is proportional to the applied load.

The parameter **E** occurring in this relationship, defined as Young's modulus of elasticity, is a constant value, characteristic for a given material (in this case the rope), and **F** is the total cross-sectional area of the rope fibers.
